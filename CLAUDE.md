# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is a newly initialized repository for the "unite-hub" project. The codebase structure and development commands will be documented here as the project evolves.

## Repository Structure

Currently, this is an empty repository with only git initialization. The project architecture and file structure will be documented here once development begins.

## Development Commands

Development commands will be added here once the project stack and build tools are established.

## Notes

- This file should be updated as the project structure and development workflow are established
- Add build, test, and lint commands when they become available
- Document the high-level architecture once components are implemented
